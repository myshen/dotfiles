# myshen's dotfiles #

Kind of a mash of mathiasbynens/dotfiles and holman/dotfiles. To be improved
for sure!

## Install ##
cd .dotfiles && bin/bootstrap.sh

## Local configuration ##
`.dotfiles_local/bash-like-common/env` is sourced by
`.dotfiles/bash-like-common/env`. Add local configuration that should not be
pushed to the public there.
